        Shakshouka ( also spelled shakshuka or chakchouka) is a Maghrebi dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes,
         olive oil, peppers, onion and garlic, commonly spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper.
          According to Joan Nathan, shakshouka originated in Ottoman North Africa in the mid-16th century
           after tomatoes were introduced to the region by Hernan Cort√©s as part of the Columbian exchange.
